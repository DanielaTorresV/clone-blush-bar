## üî® Configuration

### Step 1 - Basic setup

If you need to intall VTEX in your terminal you follow the next steps.

Access the VTEX IO [basic setup guide](https://vtex.io/docs/getting-started/build-stores-with-store-framework/1) and follow all the given steps.

By the end of the setup, you should have the VTEX command line interface (Toolbelt) installed along with a developer workspace you can work in.

### Step 2 - Cloning the Minimum Boilerplate Theme repository

You can do a store from the beginning [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository to
your local files to be able to effectively start working on it. Or clone this repository to work in a beauty store.

Then, access the repository's directory using your terminal.

### Step 3 - Editing the `Manifest.json`

Once in the repository directory, it is time to edit the Minimum Boilerplate `manifest.json` file.

Once you are in the file, you must replace the `vendor` and `account` values. `vendor` is the account name you are working on and `account` is anything you want to
name your theme. For example:

```json
{
  "vendor": "storecomponents",
  "name": "my-test-theme"
}
```

### Step 4 - Installing required apps

In order to use Store Framework and work on your store theme, it is needed to have both `vtex.store-sitemap` and `vtex.store` installed.

Run `vtex list` and check whether those apps are already installed.

If they aren't, run the following command to install them: `vtex install vtex.store-sitemap vtex.store -f`

Besides, You need to link `Custom Apss`before link the store.

### Step 5 - Uninstalling any existing theme

By running `vtex list`, you can verify if any theme is installed.

It is common to already have a `vtex.store-theme` installed when you start the store's front development process.

Therefore, if you find it in the app's list, copy its name and use it together with the command `vtex uninstall`. For example:

```json
vtex uninstall vtex.store-theme
```

### Step 6- Run and preview your store

Then time has come to upload all the changes you made in your local files to the platform. For that, use the `vtex link` command.

If the process runs without any errors, the following message will be displayed: `App linked successfully`. Then, run the `vtex browse` command to open a browser
window having your linked store in it.

This will enable you to see the applied changes in real time, through the account and workspace in which you are working.
